Final WIN32Project - CIRCLES N' SQUARES - By Ramzi Chennafi A00825005 Set 3O

A program that simply draws circles and squares. Comes complete with logo and random useless features such as
"PARTY" and "MINIPARTY". DISCLAIMER : ALSO, SEIZURE WARNING, DONT PRESS PARTY OR MINIPARTY IF YOU'RE EPLILEPTIC.

Features
	Party and Mini Party buttons - cause random screen changes
	Copy and Paste - Copy and paste your last created shape
	A modeless paint toolbox - draw shapes with double the efficency
	An about box - in case you were confused
	Working scrolling and sizing - yes! it's a first for me!
	A box that gets drawn out when you draw the shape - amazing!
	Can paint in multiple modes and shapes!

Compiling
	 Compile it in visual studio, make sure that the CPP files aren't using precompiled headers.
	 I've never compiled outside of VS, time to figure that one out.

	 I've included the entire visual studio project folder. Was unsure since it was very hard to find 
	 information for this project.

NOTES:
	Program should fufill all requirements you had. The copy and pasting only does one shape
	due to time constraints. 

BUGS:
	After erasing the shapes with the erase button, an square will appear in the top left till
	the screen is refreshed. Changing the background also momentarily destroys the logo till refresh.
