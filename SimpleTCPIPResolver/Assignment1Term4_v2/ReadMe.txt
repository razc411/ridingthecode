Included with this.. This readme, the visual studio project and a pdf containing testing and design documentation.

This is a simple GUI windows program that resolves a user provided TCP/IP IP, host, port or service
to their respective relations. Compiled and constructed in Visual Studio 2013. Requires the ws2_32.lib
and the character set must be "not set" to avoid issues with TCHARs and chars... you must also have the
Arial font. 

Notes:
If recompiling on visual studio 2010, ensure that the compiler version is set to 2010.
